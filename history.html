			<texttitle>The History of Porchester Festival<br/></texttitle>
				<textbody>In the 19th century many people who lived in this area worked in the brick making industry. Mapperley bricks built the St Pancras Hotel in London!<br/>
It was physically hard, dangerous, dirty work, and allotments were vital for them to feed their families, as they were often laid off during the winter months.<br/>
One of the creators of Porchester Freehold Garden Estate, Alderman Bennett, was from a brick making family and became manager the Nottingham Patent Brick Company Limited. He was motivated to create Porchester Gardens because his workers lost their allotment land when the City Asylum was built.</textbody>
				<textbody><br/><br/>Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury 
came to Nottingham in November 1889 for the annual Conservative conference. For him to make a special visit to Porchester Gardens shows that local dignitaries must have been very proud of the allotment gardens they had created for their workers.</textbody>
				<textbody><br/><br/>During the visit to Nottingham the Prime Minister announced plans to provide free education for the poor (an unpopular announcement amongst the press) AND took time to visit pay a special visit to the Porchester Freehold Garden Estate.<br/>
Yes that's right, not Theresa May but Lord Salisbury in November 1889.<br/>
The garden estate was created in 1887 as allotments for local workers and has been described as "a valuable institution showing the power of self help, of co-operation, of thrift, of the desire to live in quietness with healthy garden surroundings.</textbody>
